Group: /gtx

Description                 (Attribute)   Each group contains the segments for one Ground Track. As ICESat-2 orbits the earth, sequential
                                          transmit pulses illuminate six ground tracks on the surface of the earth. The track width is approximately
                                          14m. Each ground track is numbered, according to the laser spot number that generates a given ground
                                          track. Ground tracks are numbered from the left to the right in the direction of spacecraft travel as: 1L, 1R
                                          in the left-most pair of beams; 2L, 2R for the center pair of beams; and 3L, 3R for the right-most pair of
                                          beams.
